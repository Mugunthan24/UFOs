# UFOs
 JavaScript, Bootstrap, and UFOs

## Overview of Project
A website was created using HTML and JavaScript. On the website there is a table with information on various UFO sitings that were reported in January of 2010. Users can filter this table to find what they are looking for.

## Results

A user of the webpage may be interested in viewing reported UFO sitings in their city or country. By default, when the webpage first loads, the table is unfiltered and contains many entries. If a user is from Canada, and is interested in seeing the reported sitings in his/her country then they can enter "ca" in the Country field and see the UFO sightings reported in Canada. Additionally, with the use of multiple filters, they may want to also filter for a specific day in addition to filtering for Canada. Incorporating the ability to filter multiple columns in the table, greatly empowers the user and significantly improves the user experience.

## Summary
In the subsequent sections below, we will be discussing the drawbacks and potential recommendations for further developement.

### Drawbacks
One drawback to the new design of the website is that there is no error handling. For example, if in the Date field someone were to enter a city name by accident believing it to be the City field, the results in the table would be blank, leading them to potentially believe that there were no UFO sightings for that city in the table.

### Recommendations
The first recommendation would be to include error handling. Using the example explained in the previous section if a user were to enter a city name in the Date Field believing it to be the City Field, they would be lead to believe that there were no UFO sightings for that city in the table when there potentially was. With error handling, the user would be notified that their entry in the Date Field was invalid because it was not a date. If error handling was incorporated into all the fields, then the users would be able to know if they entered something invalid improving the user experience.

The second recommendation would be to have the values in the City, State, Country, and Shape columns be written in proper case. This will make the table and site look much more professional.

Lastly, it would be beneficial for the user if some of the fields were dropdowns. If the City, State, and Country fields were dropdowns that adapt and update their options based on previous selections this would greatly enhance the users experience making the table easier to filter. Some users may not know exactly how to spell a cities name so having the dropdown option would be useful. Additionally, if the dropdown options for a field update based on a previous dropdown selection, then this would significantly enhance the user experience. For example, if in the Country field Canada was selected, then the City and State columns should update to only have cities, and states (provinces and territories) in Canada. 

In addition to the City, State, and Country fields being dropdowns, a dropdown calendar can be added to the Date field. Users may enter a date in the wrong format and having a dropdown calendar option for this field will combat this problem.
